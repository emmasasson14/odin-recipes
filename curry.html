        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Thai curry (Thai: แกง, pronounced [kɛ̄ːŋ]) is a dish 
            in Thai cuisine made from curry paste, coconut milk or water,
             meat, seafood, vegetables or fruit, and herbs. Curries in 
             Thailand mainly differ from the curries in Indian cuisine in their 
             use of ingredients such as herbs and aromatic leaves 
             over a mix of spices.</p>
